# How do we define our roadmap?

Our vision, mission, objectives and design principles serve as the framework for the definition of our long term roadmap and guide every aspect of our project by describing what we need to accomplish in order to continue to fulfill our promise of building a state-of-the-art open source framework that addresses the scalability, flexibility and security requirements of large-scale production systems.

The requirements of our users are the driving force behind all our development efforts. Pushkin features fulfill real needs of leading IT organizations running production environments. This requires us to be agile and flexible in order to quickly adapt to our user needs and the market challenges. So the roadmap needs to be flexible enough to deal with and take advantage of rapid changes in the industry. This is the reason why we only publish our short-term roadmap, which is the description of the features planned for the next release of the software.

We will be also happy to discuss any ideas for next releases on the [Pushkin-Dev Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pushkin-dev).
